# 安德烈 Andre — Image Generation Prompts (LIGHT: 00, 05, 06)

> **Two-stage rule (mandatory).** Stage 1 generates ONLY `00-andre-character-identity-anchor.png` using the three shared style images to lock the common art style. The three style images control STYLE ONLY — never copy their characters' faces, hairstyles or costumes. Stop after 00 and wait for the user to approve or request changes.
> **05 and 06 must NOT be generated until the user has approved 00.** Once approved, `00-andre-character-identity-anchor.png` becomes the SOLE identity/costume authority (Image 1) for every Stage-2 prompt below; the three style images stay style-only.
> This is the LIGHT package: only 00 (anchor), 05 (four-view master) and 06 (eight-expression sheet). Each prompt below is independent and self-contained. Do not merge them.

Shared style references (style only, do not copy their characters):

## 00 — `00-andre-character-identity-anchor.png`  (STAGE 1 — generate this one only, then wait for approval)

```text
Use case: stylized-concept
Asset type: new-character identity anchor sheet

Input images:
- Image 1: shared visual-style reference only. Do not copy the depicted character's identity, face, hairstyle, costume or anatomy.
- Image 2: shared visual-style reference only. Do not copy the depicted character's identity, face, hairstyle, costume or anatomy.
- Image 3: shared visual-style reference only. Do not copy the depicted character's identity, face, hairstyle, costume or anatomy.

Character definition:
Andre, an ELDERLY lean composed scholar-noble (CANON elderly, apparent age 60-70), CANON height ~178cm, lean upright but aged frame. CANON facial identity: an aged lean face with visible age lines and defined cheekbones, gray hair neatly combed straight back, a LOCKED neatly-trimmed short gray beard, and fathomless calm half-lidded LOCKED deep-gray eyes that give nothing away; a poised, quiet, unreadable expression. Fair aged skin. Costume version: dark scholar-robe version (CANON direction) - a dark, understated PLANE-TREE (梧桐) house-crest scholar/literati robe, the crest LOCKED as a stylized five-lobed plane-tree (sycamore) leaf in dark-gold embroidery, unarmored and unshowy, layered inner and outer robe, a crossed or standing collar in muted dark tones, wide scholar sleeves, a plain cloth sash at the waist, ankle-length hem, simple soft shoes; he holds a LOCKED tea cup in one hand in the full-body view. Materials: dark matte cloth / literati woven fabric only, minimal metal (dark-gold crest thread only); no armor, no gemstone finery, no gold pauldrons. Palette: deep ink-green to charcoal-gray with dark-gold crest embroidery, dark-brown inner robe, aligned with the whole story's converged gold / silver-blue / dark scheme.

Primary request:
Design one new and visually distinct character from the written specification. Create an identity-anchor sheet containing exactly two views of the same character: one neutral straight-on full-body front view and one large straight-on head-and-shoulders portrait. Both views must have identical facial identity, hairstyle, colors, costume and accessories. Preserve the elderly aged features (age lines, gray hair, gray beard) in BOTH views. The head-and-shoulders portrait is the facial identity authority for later generations.

Sheet layout: a single ultra-wide horizontal sheet, aspect ratio approximately 3:1 (reference 2048x672). Left ~55% of the canvas holds one neutral straight-on FULL-BODY front view, entire body from top of head to soles inside frame. Right ~45% holds one large straight-on HEAD-AND-SHOULDERS portrait of the same character, the head occupying at least 60% of that panel's height so the face reads clearly as the identity authority. Both halves share identical face, hair, colors and costume; no identity drift.

Style:
refined Japanese anime fantasy character design, professional production character sheet, elegant slender proportions, clean delicate linework, controlled fine outlines, soft cel shading blended with subtle painterly rendering, highly detailed costume construction, ornate but readable fantasy design, precise embroidery, layered fabric, polished metal, fabric-focused material separation with minimal dark-metal fittings, restrained luminous highlights, soft neutral studio lighting, low-contrast warm light-gray background, clean orthographic presentation, balanced negative space, consistent scale and anatomy, high-resolution concept art

Negative prompt:
photorealistic, 3D render, western comic style, chibi, super-deformed, thick outlines, harsh lineart, sketchy unfinished lines, flat unshaded colors, muddy colors, excessive bloom, dramatic cinematic background, scenery, action pose, extreme perspective, fisheye, cropped body, inconsistent anatomy, different face, different hairstyle, costume redesign, random accessories, duplicate character, extra limbs, extra fingers, text, labels, letters, numbers, logo, signature, watermark, jpeg artifacts, low resolution, blurry, armor, plate armor, cuirass, gauntlets, wings, horns, tail, youthful face, young man, teenager, smooth wrinkle-free skin, de-aged face, crown, weapon, sword, gemstone finery, ornate jewels, gold pauldrons, reference character face, copying any style-image character, blending the three reference characters, Kritz black-and-gold pauldrons, shoulder chains, purple gemstones, Revanas ice-crystal horns, crystalline wings, white-gold pale-purple clergy robe

Constraints:
- The three input images control visual style only; do not reproduce or blend their characters.
- The three style images define lighting, linework, shading and material rendering ONLY. Do NOT reproduce their characters' faces, hairstyles, costumes, colors or anatomy, and do not blend them into this character.
- Follow all CANON facts exactly (elderly aged lean face with age lines, gray combed-back hair, fathomless calm eyes, dark plane-tree house-crest scholar robe, tea cup or old book).
- Follow approved DESIGN-PROPOSAL items consistently.
- Do not invent unresolved PENDING-USER-INPUT details.
- Keep the character clearly elderly; do not render a youthful face.
- Neutral front-facing presentation, plain warm light-gray background, no scene or action pose.
- No text, labels, logo, signature or watermark.
- Exactly one character identity shown twice; no identity drift between the two views.
