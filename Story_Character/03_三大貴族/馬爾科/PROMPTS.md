# 馬爾科 Marco — Image Generation Prompts (LIGHT: 00, 05, 06)

> **Two-stage rule (mandatory).** Stage 1 generates ONLY `00-marco-character-identity-anchor.png` using the three shared style images to lock the common art style. The three style images control STYLE ONLY — never copy their characters' faces, hairstyles or costumes. Stop after 00 and wait for the user to approve or request changes.
> **05 and 06 must NOT be generated until the user has approved 00.** Once approved, `00-marco-character-identity-anchor.png` becomes the SOLE identity/costume authority (Image 1) for every Stage-2 prompt below; the three style images stay style-only.
> This is the LIGHT package: only 00 (anchor), 05 (four-view master) and 06 (eight-expression sheet). Each prompt below is independent and self-contained. Do not merge them.

Shared style references (style only, do not copy their characters):

## 00 — `00-marco-character-identity-anchor.png`  (STAGE 1 — generate this one only, then wait for approval)

```text
Use case: stylized-concept
Asset type: new-character identity anchor sheet

Input images:
- Image 1: shared visual-style reference only. Do not copy the depicted character's identity, face, hairstyle, costume or anatomy.
- Image 2: shared visual-style reference only. Do not copy the depicted character's identity, face, hairstyle, costume or anatomy.
- Image 3: shared visual-style reference only. Do not copy the depicted character's identity, face, hairstyle, costume or anatomy.

Character definition:
Marco, a burly imposing middle-aged warlord-noble (apparent age 45-52), CANON height ~192cm, massive broad-shouldered heavyweight build (bull-necked, barrel-chested, NOT slender). CANON facial identity: a square jaw with a wide angular chin, a short trimmed beard and moustache, and fierce intimidating LOCKED steel-gray eyes with a menacing provoking gaze. Deep weather-beaten bronze skin, short stiff iron-gray-and-black hair. Costume version: valley/court council heavy-armor version (CANON direction) - he wears cold iron / steel plate armor even at the council table, never removing it, using force as his voice: a full iron cuirass with the MASTIFF (獒犬) house crest LOCKED as a front-facing snarling mastiff-hound head with bared fangs in dark-gold relief, embossed/etched on the chest, huge pauldrons bearing the same mastiff-head motif, a tall steel gorget collar over dark inner cloth, plate bracers and steel gauntlets, an iron-buckled wide waist belt bearing a broadsword, knee-length tassets/faulds plus a heavy house-crest cloak, full leg plate and iron boots. Materials: cold iron and steel plate metal with dark-gold mastiff-crest etching; no silk, no gemstone finery. Palette: cold iron-gray / deep steel armor dominant with dark-gold crest etching and a LOCKED ink-black house-crest cloak, aligned with the whole story's converged gold / silver-blue / dark scheme.

Primary request:
Design one new and visually distinct character from the written specification. Create an identity-anchor sheet containing exactly two views of the same character: one neutral straight-on full-body front view and one large straight-on head-and-shoulders portrait. Both views must have identical facial identity, hairstyle, colors, costume and accessories. The head-and-shoulders portrait is the facial identity authority for later generations.

Sheet layout: a single ultra-wide horizontal sheet, aspect ratio approximately 3:1 (reference 2048x672). Left ~55% of the canvas holds one neutral straight-on FULL-BODY front view, entire body from top of head to soles inside frame. Right ~45% holds one large straight-on HEAD-AND-SHOULDERS portrait of the same character, the head occupying at least 60% of that panel's height so the face reads clearly as the identity authority. Both halves share identical face, hair, colors and costume; no identity drift.

Style:
refined Japanese anime fantasy character design, professional production character sheet, elegant slender proportions, clean delicate linework, controlled fine outlines, soft cel shading blended with subtle painterly rendering, highly detailed costume construction, ornate but readable fantasy design, precise embroidery, layered fabric, polished metal, leather and gemstone material separation, restrained luminous highlights, soft neutral studio lighting, low-contrast warm light-gray background, clean orthographic presentation, balanced negative space, consistent scale and anatomy, high-resolution concept art

Negative prompt:
photorealistic, 3D render, western comic style, chibi, super-deformed, thick outlines, harsh lineart, sketchy unfinished lines, flat unshaded colors, muddy colors, excessive bloom, dramatic cinematic background, scenery, action pose, extreme perspective, fisheye, cropped body, inconsistent anatomy, different face, different hairstyle, costume redesign, random accessories, duplicate character, extra limbs, extra fingers, text, labels, letters, numbers, logo, signature, watermark, jpeg artifacts, low resolution, blurry, slender build, thin frame, slim youth, wings, horns, tail, robe-only costume, unarmored, cloth robe without armor, crown, young boyish face, clean-shaven, ornate gemstone finery, jeweled rings, clergy silk robe, reference character face, copying any style-image character, blending the three reference characters, Kritz black-and-gold pauldrons, shoulder chains, purple gemstones, Revanas ice-crystal horns, crystalline wings, tail, white-gold pale-purple clergy robe

Constraints:
- The three input images control visual style only; do not reproduce or blend their characters.
- The three style images define lighting, linework, shading and material rendering ONLY. Do NOT reproduce their characters' faces, hairstyles, costumes, colors or anatomy, and do not blend them into this character.
- Follow all CANON facts exactly (192cm burly heavyweight build, square jaw, short beard, fierce eyes, heavy iron/plate armor worn at all times, mastiff house crest on the chest).
- Follow approved DESIGN-PROPOSAL items consistently.
- Do not invent unresolved PENDING-USER-INPUT details.
- Neutral front-facing presentation, plain warm light-gray background, no scene or action pose.
- No text, labels, logo, signature or watermark.
